# NIRC2-pol
NIRC2 polarimetry mode code and documentation

**Hardware Documentation**
The NIRC2 PCU contains two waveplates: one for J/H/K bands, and one for L band. 
Further information on the hardware can be found [here]([url](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/2/folders/1_Re45YMen-DIj2tEE0324fG9Wq7jTyPB)).
Information on the measured properties (retardance vs. wavelength, throughput, beam and focus shift) is [in this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1E3p6K6aG9DB5wS8JrpiJPAXkMdCpnKzTrQwcCg9Xu5c/edit?usp=sharing). Note: revised throughput measurements coming soon.
